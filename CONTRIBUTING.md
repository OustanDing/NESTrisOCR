#TODO This file needs to be fleshed out.

After pulling the code and setting it up, please run

`pre-commit install`
`pip install flake8`
`pip install black`

This will hook up syntax/style checking so commits are easier to process.

Before commiting, autoformat:

`black .` 


Follow this with the standard pre-commit check:

`flake8`
